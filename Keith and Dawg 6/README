I used an online URL fuzzer tool to find any other .php files behind that webserver.
Sure enough there is 3.php, which is from the removed problem 'Keith and Dawg 3'.

I just started to mess around with it and inputed
	admin" OR IF(1=1, true, false); #
for username and any random string for password.

And somehow I got the flag.

the flag is: 814213eb444efc2eb8116b0f3b224f2c
